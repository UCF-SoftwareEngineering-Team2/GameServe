## UCF [COP 4331] Software-Engineering Project Page 
-------------------------

- [X] Need all the navigation links looked at. 'Create event' button isn't toggled when create page is the current page.

- [X] Gotta do something about the pop up for the login. I prefer the registration button as one of the navi buttons alongside login, create event, browse, and home; only display login and register for those who aren't logged in.

- [X] Facebook login/registration is working.  Just need a button for it.

- [ ] Google Maps Js needs fiddling

- [ ] Have to remove unused js files and consolidate short ones into a single js file. Makes cross referencing a pain

- [X] Need login page `/accounts/login/`, registration page `/accounts/signup` styled to match other pages. (frontend?)

 
- [ ] Comments on code (even a single sentence) for EVERYTHING from now on until submission!


- [ ] Filter Events on browse

- [ ] Commit/Uncommit to event

- [ ] User shouldn't be able to commit to two events with overlapping date and time.




## Optional

- Comments on events.

- Upload User image
