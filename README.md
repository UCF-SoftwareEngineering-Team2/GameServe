## UCF [COP 4331] Software-Engineering Project Page 
-------------------------

- [ ] Comments (even a single sentence) for EVERYTHING from now on until submission!

- [ ] Need login page `/accounts/login/`, registration page `/accounts/signup` styled to match other pages. (frontend?)

- [X] Need all the navigation links looked at. 'Create event' button isn't toggled when create page is the current page.

- [X] Gotta do something about the pop up for the login. I prefer the registration button as one of the navi buttons alongside login, create event, browse, and home; only display login and register for those who aren't logged in.

- [X] Facebook login/registration is working.  Just need a button for it.

- [ ] Google Maps Js needs fiddling

- [ ] Have to remove unused js files and consolidate short ones into a single js file. Makes cross referencing a pain
